    "### Maximum Likelihood Estimates or MLE on a binary multivariate logistic analysis, which is used to model dependent variables to determine the expected probability of success of belonging to a certain group. For instance, given a set of independent variables (e.g., age, income, and education level of credit card or mortgage loan holders), I model the probability of credit loan default using MLE. A typical regression model is invalid because the errors are heteroskedastic and non-normal, and the resulting estimated probability estimates will sometimes be above 1 or below 0. MLE analysis handles these problems using an iterative optimization routine."

    "#### The data which I used represents a sample of several hundred previous loans, credit, or debt issues. The data showed whether each loan had defaulted or not, as well as the specifics of each loan applicant's age, education level (ndicating high school, university, or graduate professional education), years with current employer and so forth. The idea is to model these empirical data to see which variables affect the default behavior of individuals, using Risk Simulator's Maximum Likelihood Models. The resulting model will help a bank or a credit issuer compute the expected probability of default of an individual credit holder of having specific characteristics."
